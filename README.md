# concrete-algebra
A textbook of elementary undergraduate algebra with an emphasis on hand and computer computation, as a precursor to the usual big algebra texts. The textbook is the file algebra.pdf; the other files compile (with algebra.tex as the main LaTeX file) under pdfLaTex to make that file.
