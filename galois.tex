\section{Automorphisms}
An \emph{automorphism}\define{automorphism} of a ring \(R\) is a morphism \(f \colon R \to R\) which has an inverse \(f^{-1} \colon R \to R\), which is also a morphism.
\begin{problem}{galois:aut.gp}
Prove that the set of all automorphisms of any ring \(R\) is a group, the \emph{automorphism group}\define{automorphism!group}\define{group!automorphism} of \(R\).
\end{problem}
\begin{example}
The set of rational numbers of the form \(b+c\sqrt{2}\), for \(b,c \in \Q{}\), forms a field, usually denoted \(\Q{}(\sqrt{2})\).
Indeed, when we add such numbers
\[
(7+3\sqrt{2}) \, + \, (4-\sqrt{2}) 
=
(7+4)+(3-1)\sqrt{2}.
\]
Similarly if we subtract.
If we multiply,
\[
(7+3\sqrt{2})(4-\sqrt{2}) 
=
\pr{ 
7 \cdot 4
+ 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 2
}
+
\pr{
7 \cdot \pr{-1}+3 \cdot 4
}
\sqrt{2}.
\]
Finally, to compute reciprocals,
\[
\frac{1}{7+6\sqrt{2}}=\frac{1}{7+6\sqrt{2}}\frac{7-6\sqrt{2}}{7-6\sqrt{2}}=\frac{7-6\sqrt{2}}{7^2-2 \cdot 6^2}
\]
which the reader can simplify.
The map
\[
f(b+c\sqrt{2})=b-c\sqrt{2}
\]
is an automorphism, i.e. a morphism of the field to itself.
Note that \(f^{-1}=f\).
\end{example}
\begin{problem}{galois:preserve.minus}
Prove that every morphism \(f \colon R \to S\) of rings preserves subtraction.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}{galois:preserve.minus}
If \(z=x-y\) then \(f(x)=f(y+z)=f(y)+f(z)\) so \(f(z)=f(x)-f(y)\).
\end{answer}
Suppose that \(R\) is a ring.
Suppose that, for any elements \(b,c\) of \(R\) with \(c\ne 0\), there is a unique element \(d\) of \(R\) so that \(dc=b\).
Write this element as \(d=b/c\) and say that \(R\) has \emph{right inverses}.
\begin{lemma}
Every morphism \(f \colon R \to S\) of rings with right inverses preserves right inverses.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If \(d=b/c\) then \(dc=b\) so \(f(dc)=f(b)=f(d)f(c)\) so \(f(d)=f(b)/f(c)\).
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
Every automorphism of a ring preserves \(0\).
Every automorphism of a ring with identity preserves the identity element.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Every element \(b\) of \(R\) satisfies \(b=0+b=b+0\).
Any automorphism \(h \colon R \to R\) satisfies \(h(b)=h(0+b)=h(0)+h(b)=h(b+0)=h(b)+h(0)\) for all \(b \in R\).
Since \(h\) has an inverse, \(h\) is one-to-one and onto, so every element \(c\) of \(R\) has the form \(c=h(b)\) for some \(b \in R\).
So \(c=h(0)+c=c+h(0)\) for all \(c\) in \(R\).
In particular, taking \(c=0\), \(0=h(0)+0=h(0)\).

Every element \(b\) of \(R\) satisfies \(b=1b=b1\).
Any automorphism \(h \colon R \to R\) satisfies \(h(b)=h(1b)=h(1)h(b)=h(b1)=h(b)h(1)\) for all \(b \in R\).
Since \(h\) has an inverse, \(h\) is one-to-one and onto, so every element \(c\) of \(R\) has the form \(c=h(b)\) for some \(b \in R\).
So \(c=h(1)c=ch(1)\) for all \(c\) in \(R\).
In particular, taking \(c=1\), \(1=h(1)1=h(1)\).
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
The only automorphism of any of the fields \(\Q{},\R{}\) or \(\Zmod{p}\) is the identity map \(b \mapsto b\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that \(k=\Q{}\) or \(k=\R{}\) or \(k=\Zmod{p}\).
If \(f \colon k \to k\) is an automorphism, then \(f(1)=1\).
Therefore \(f(1+1)=f(1)+f(1)=1+1\).
Similarly \(f(1+1+1)=1+1+1\), and so on.
Therefore if \(k=\Zmod{p}\) we have exhausted all elements of \(k\) and \(f(b)=b\) for every element \(b\) of \(k\).
In the same way, if \(k=\Q{}\) or \(k=\R{}\), then \(k(n)=n\) for all positive integers \(n\).
Similarly, \(f(0)=0\).
But then \(f(-n)=f(0-n)=f(0)-f(n)=0-f(n)=-f(n)\).
So \(f\) is the identity map on the integers.
Apply \(f\) to a ratio \(b/c\) of integers, and since \(f\) preserves right inverses, \(f(b/c)=f(b)/f(c)=b/c\).
Hence if \(k=\Q{}\), then \(f\) is the identity map.

We can assume that \(k=\R{}\).
Say that a number \(x\) in \(\R{}\) is \emph{positive} if \(x \ne 0\) and \(x=y^2\) for some number \(y\).
Clearly positivity is preserved under any automorphism.
Write \(x < y\) to mean that \(y-x\) is positive, and \(x \le y\) to mean that \(y-x\) is positive or zero.
Automorphisms preserve the ordering of real numbers.
Take any real number \(x\) and approximate \(x\) from below by rational numbers \(r_1,r_2,\dots, \to x\) and from above by rational numbers \(s_1,s_2,\dots \to x\).
Then \(r_i < x < s_i\) so applying \(f\): \(r_i < f(x) < s_i\).
It follows that \(f(x)=x\), as real numbers as completely determined by their digits, i.e. by approximation by rationals.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
There are two automorphisms of \(\Q{}(\sqrt{2})\): the identity map \(\iota(b+c\sqrt{2})=b+c\sqrt{2}\) and the map
\[
f(b+c\sqrt{2})=b-c\sqrt{2}.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The same argument as above shows that any automorphism \(h\) of \(\Q{}(\sqrt{2})\) fixes all rational numbers \(\Q{}\subset \Q{}(\sqrt{2})\).
So \(h(b+c\sqrt{2})=h(b)+h(c)h(\sqrt{2})=b+ch(\sqrt{2})\): it suffices to determine \(h(\sqrt{2})\).
Note that \(\sqrt{2}^2=2\), so apply \(h\) to get \(h(\sqrt{2})^2=2\), i.e. \(h(\sqrt{2})=\pm \sqrt{2}\).
\end{proof}

\section{Galois groups}
The \emph{Galois group}\define{Galois group}\define{group!Galois} of a field extension \(k \subset K\), denoted \(\Gal{k}{K}\) is the group of automorphisms of \(K\) which are the identity on \(k\).
\begin{example}
We found above that \(\Gal{\Q{}}{\Q{}(\sqrt{2})}=\set{\pm 1}\) where we let \(-1\) denote the transformation \(b+c\sqrt{2}=b-c\sqrt{2}\).
\end{example}
If \(b(x)\) is a polynomial with coefficients in \(k\), and \(g\) is a automorphism of \(K\) fixing all elements of \(k\), then \(g(b(x))=b(x)\), i.e. \(g\) fixes all coefficients.
Therefore if \(\alpha\) is a root of \(b(x)\) lying in \(K\), then so is \(g\alpha\):
\(
0=b(\alpha)=\sum b_j \alpha^j
\)
so
\[
0=g(b(\alpha)) = \sum b_j g(\alpha)^j.
\]
Hence the Galois group \(\Gal{k}{K}\) of a field extension \(K/k\) acts on the roots in \(K\) of all polynomials over \(k\).
If a polynomial splits into factors over \(k\), then clearly the Galois group \(\Gal{k}{K}\) permutes the \(K\)-roots of each factor individually.
\begin{example}
The Galois group of \(\Q{}(\sqrt{2})/\Q{}\) permutes \(\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}\), the roots of \(x^2-2\).
Note that the elements of \(\Q{}(\sqrt{2})\) have the form \(a+b\sqrt{2}\), for \(a,b\) rational.
Hence the elements of \(\Q{}(\sqrt{2}\) fixed by the Galois group are precisely the elements of \(\Q{}\).
\end{example}
A \emph{Galois extension}\define{Galois extension}\define{extension!Galois} is an extension \(K/k\) so that the elements of \(K\) fixed by \(\Gal{k}{K}\) are precisely the elements of \(k\).
\begin{example}
In chapter~\ref{chapter:fields} we checked that the field \(K\defeq\Q{}(\sqrt[3]{2})\) consists of the numbers \(a+b2^{1/3}+c2^{2/3}\) for \(a,b,c\) rational.
Note that \(K\) is a subfield of the field of real numbers.
There is only one real number \(\alpha\) that satisfies \(\alpha^3=2\): the real number \(\alpha=2^{1/3}\).
Therefore there is only one element \(\alpha\) of \(K\) that satisfies \(\alpha^3=2\): the element \(\alpha=2^{1/3}\).
So every automorphism of \(K\) sends \(2^{1/3}\) to itself.
The Galois group of \(K/\Q{}\) is \(\Gal{\Q{}}{K}=\set{1}\).
The extension \(\Q{}(\sqrt[3]{2})/\Q{}\) is \emph{not} a Galois extension; the Galois group is too small, fixing everything.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Let \(K\) be the splitting field of \(p(x)=x^3-2\) over \(k=\Q{}\).
There are 3 complex cube roots of \(2\): the real number \(2^{1/3}\), and its two rotations by a third of a revolution around the origin: call them \(\alpha\) and \(\bar\alpha\).
As we will see, by theorem~\vref{theorem:irreducible.orbit}, because \(p(x)\) is irreducible over \(k\), any two of these roots are swapped by some element of the Galois group of \(K/k\).
We can draw one of these permutations: complex conjugation preserves \(2^{1/3}\), and preserves the polynomial, and swaps the angles of the other roots, preserving their lengths, so swaps the other two roots.
Any permutation of the three roots arises as a unique element of the Galois group: once we swap roots to get any root we like to sit in the spot \(2^{1/3}\), we can then permute the other two by complex conjugation if they are not already where we want them.
So the Galois group of \(K/k\) is the symmetric group on 3 letters.
In particular, \(K/k\) is a Galois extension.
\end{example}

\section{Adding roots}
\begin{example}
Start with a field \(k\), and take two elements \(b,c \in k\).
The roots of the equation \(0=x^2+bx+c\) lie in some extension \(K\).
To be specific, the quadratic formula
\[
x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2}
\]
shows that the roots of our quadratic equation lie in the field \(K=k(\sqrt{b^2-4ac})\), as long as \(k\) has characteristic not equal to \(2\).
In fields of characteristic \(2\), the quadratic formula doesn't hold, and the splitting field is more complicated.
\end{example}
\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:splitting.Galois}
Suppose that \(K\) is a splitting field of an irreducible polynomial \(p(x)\) over a field \(k\).
If \(\alpha,\beta \in K\) are roots of \(p(x)\) then the Galois group of \(K\) over \(k\) has an element which takes \(\alpha\) to \(\beta\).
In particular, \(K\) is a Galois extension of \(k\).
\end{theorem}
We will prove this result in chapter~\ref{chapter:quotient.rings}.
\begin{example}
Return to our previous example: in chapter~\ref{chapter:fields} we checked that the field \(K\defeq\Q{}(\sqrt[3]{2})\) consists of the numbers \(a+b2^{1/3}+c2^{2/3}\) for \(a,b,c\) rational.
Above, we saw that \(K\) has trivial Galois group over \(k=\Q{}\).
The polynomial \(p(x)=x^3-2\) has a root in \(K\), but not all of its roots.
Our theorem says that the splitting field \(L\) of \(p(x)\) over \(k\) is Galois.
Let \(\alpha=\sqrt[3]{2}\), so \(K=k(\alpha)\).
Factor \(p(x)=(x-\alpha)(x^2+\alpha x + \alpha^2)\).
But \(x^2+\alpha x + \alpha^2\) has no roots in \(K\), since its roots are not real (as we will see), while \(K\) lies inside \(\R{}\).
We need to extend to \(L\) to find roots for \(x^2+\alpha x + \alpha^2\), i.e. the two remaining roots of \(p(x)\).
Since \(x^2+\alpha x + \alpha^2\) is quadratic, \(L\) is a quadratic extension of \(K\), i.e. \(L=K(\beta)\) is given by adding
\[
\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-\alpha \pm\sqrt{\alpha^2-4\alpha^2}}{2} =
-\frac{\alpha}{2}\left(1\pm \sqrt{-3} \right),
\]
i.e. \(L=K(\sqrt{-3})=k(\sqrt[3]{2},\sqrt{-3})\).
Automorphisms of \(L\) fixing \(k\) are determined by their action on \(\sqrt[3]{2}\) and \(\sqrt{-3}\).
Complex conjugation is one such automorphism.
Let \(\omega\) be the cube root of \(1\) lying in the upper half plane.
The three roots of \(p(x)\) are \(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega \sqrt[3]{2}\) and \(\bar\omega \sqrt[3]{2}\).
Complex conjugation swaps the last two roots.
Some other automorphism in the Galois group swaps the first two roots, by the theorem.
That map then must leave the other root alone, as it must remain a root.
So we can identify two automorphisms in the Galois group.
Composing these two, we see that every permutation of the roots \(\sqrt[3]{2}, \omega \sqrt[3]{2}\) and \(\bar\omega \sqrt[3]{2}\) is obtained by a unique automorphism in the Galois group of \(L\) over \(k\), i.e. \(\Gal{k}{L}\) is the symmetric group on three letters.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Pick a prime \(p\).
Over \(k=\Q{}\), factor \(x^p-1=(x-1)(x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\dots+x+1)\).
The second factor is irreducible by problem~\vref{problem:polynomials:Eisenstein.cyclotomic}.
The Galois group then takes any \(p\)-th root of \(1\) to any other (except for \(1\) itself, which is fixed).
Once we take the root \(\omega=e^{2\pi i/5}\) to some other root, \(\omega^n\), this determines the automorphism, as all other roots are powers of \(\omega\).
The Galois group is thus given by automorphisms \(\phi_n(\omega)=\omega^n\), which clearly commute, forming the cyclic group of order 5.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
For abstract variables \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) and any field \(k\), the field \(L=k(x_1,\dots,x_n)\) contains the subfield \(K=k(e_1,\dots,e_n)\) generated by the elementary symmetric polynomials in \(x_1,\dots,x_n\).
By problem~\vref{problem:permuting.roots:rationals}, this subfield is precisely the elements invariant under permutations of the variables.
Hence its Galois group \(\Gal{K}{L}\) is the symmetric group on \(n\) letters.
\end{example}
\begin{problem}{galois:symmetric.polynomials}
Suppose that \(p(x)\) is a polynomial with coefficients in a field \(k\), and with roots in some extension \(K\) of \(k\), say \(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_n\).
Prove that, for any symmetric polynomial \(q\) with coefficients in \(k\), \(q(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)\) belongs to \(k\).
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}{galois:symmetric.polynomials}
The elementary symmetric polynomials of the roots are the coefficients of \(p(x)\).
All symmetric functions are polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials.
A different proof: all of \(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\) belong to the splitting field of \(p(x)\) inside \(K\).
So we can assume without loss of generality that \(K\) is the splitting field of \(p(x)\).
The Galois group of \(K/k\) acts as permutations of \(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n\), fixing \(k\), so fixes \(q(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_n)\).
But \(K\) is a Galois extension of \(k\), so the fixed elements under the Galois group are precisely the elements of \(k\).
\end{answer}
\begin{theorem}
Suppose that \(K\) is the splitting field of an irreducible monic polynomial \(p(x)\) over a field \(k\).
Let \(d\) be the discriminant of \(p(x)\), i.e. the resultant of \(p(x),p'(x)\).
Then \((-1)^{n(n-1)/2}d\) is a square in \(K\), say \(\alpha^2\), so has a square root \(\alpha\) in \(K\).
The field extension \(k(\alpha) \subset K\) has Galois group \(\Gal{k(\alpha)}{K} \subset \Gal{k}{K}\) consisting precisely of the even permutations of the roots in \(\Gal{k}{K}\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Problem~\vref{problem:resultants:discriminant.as.product} shows that
\[
d=(-1)^{n(n-1)/2}\prod_{i<j}(x_i-x_j)^2,
\]
so we can take
\[
\alpha=\prod_{i<j}(x_i-x_j),
\]
or any multiple by any square of \(-1\), or the same expression after any permutation of roots.
This \(\alpha\) is precisely the polynomial we encountered in lemma~\vref{lemma:sign.of.permutation}, which changes sign when we permute roots, according to the sign of the permutation.

Every automorphism of \(K\) fixing all elements of \(k(\alpha)\) fixes all elements of \(k \subset k(\alpha)\), so \(\Gal{k(\alpha)}{K} \subset \Gal{k}{K}\).
Given an automorphism \(g\) in \(\Gal{k}{K}\), it permutes the roots of \(p(x)\), so acts on \(\alpha\) as the sign of that permutation, so fixes \(\alpha\) just when it is even as a permutation.
But it fixes \(k\) in any case, so fixes \(k(\alpha)\) just when it fixes \(\alpha\).
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
Return to the splitting field \(K\) of \(x^3-2\) over \(k=\Q{}\).
We saw that \(\Gal{k}{K}\) is the symmetric group on three letters.
We compute the discriminant \(\Delta=\Delta_{x^3-2}=108\).
So \(d=(-1)^{3(2)/2}\Delta=-108\), which has no square root in \(k=\Q{}\).
We adjoin a square root to \(-108\), or equivalently to \(-3\) since \(-108=2^2 3^2 (-3)\) , so \(\alpha=\sqrt{-3}\), and \(\Gal{k(\alpha)}{K}\) is the alternating group on three letters.
\end{example}

\section{Radical extensions}
A \emph{simple extension}\define{simple extension}\define{extension!simple} of a field \(k\) is an extension \(K\), denoted \(k(\alpha)\), with an element \(\alpha\) of \(K\), so that every element of \(K\) is a rational function \(b(\alpha)/c(\alpha)\) with coefficients in \(k\).
A \emph{simple radical extension}\define{simple extension}\define{extension!simple} of a field \(k\) is an extension \(k(\alpha)\) for which \(\alpha\) satisfies an equation \(\alpha^n=c\) for some element \(c\) of \(k\); we usually write such an extension as \(k(\sqrt[n]{c})\).
A \emph{radical extension} is the result of repeated simple radical extensions \(k(\alpha_1)(\alpha_2)\dots(\alpha_n)\).
\begin{example}
If we allow repeated radical extensions, we might as well extend by a prime root each time, since \(\sqrt[6]{\alpha}\) can be added by first adding \(\beta=\sqrt[2]{\alpha}\) and then adding \(\sqrt[3]{\beta}\).
\end{example}
\begin{example}
The extension \(\Q{}(x,y)/\Q{}\) (adding two abstract variables) admits an automorphism \(x \mapsto y\), \(y \mapsto x\).
But the extension \(\Q{}(\sqrt{x},y)/\Q{}\) doesn't admit this automorphism, since we have no \(\sqrt{y}\).
This is easy to fix: just add a \(\sqrt{y}\).
\end{example}
\begin{lemma}
Suppose that \(K\) is an extension of a field \(k\), and that \(\Gal{k}{K}\) is a finite group.
For every radical extension \(E\) of \(K\), there is a radical extension \(F\) of \(E\) so that the action of \(\Gal{k}{K}\) on \(K\) extends to an action on \(F\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
If we have some element \(\alpha\) of \(K\) and some radical \(\sqrt[m]{\alpha}\), we just need to add some element \(\sqrt[m]{g\alpha}\) for every \(g\) in \(\Gal{k}{K}\), and repeat as needed.
\end{proof}
